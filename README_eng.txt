Laboratory work №5
Option 1
Given rectangular matrix A = {aij} to sort by a merge sort; for the sorted matrix find the value of the function F(fi(aij)); algorithm for sorting matrix, calculating fi(aij), input and output of the matrix design in the form of functions; enter matrix elements from the keyboard; the program should display a sorted matrix, all values ​​of fi (aij) and values ​​of the function F (fi (aij)). To solve the problem, use the class of one-dimensional array, member functions and friendly functions. Arrange the elements of the rows of the matrix in descending order of their values
To run the program, create a new project in Visual Studio 2019 according to the template "Empty project (C ++)" and add to it's directory next files, which you can find in the last merge:
Resource files: Source.cpp, MethodRealization.cpp;  
Header files: Goro.h.
